* FEATURE REQUESTS: Detailed
*******************************************************************************

==== Delays ====
  jonetsu:
    The benefit with using delays is that there are no tails to manage. Also, those delays can be colorized by
    EQ (dull is farther, bright is closer) and adjusted accordingly with compression. The compression has to work
    in the same way as the EQ, not against.

  sadko4u:
	Your explanations helped me to understand what another plugin we are currently missing in linux audio. I think that
	plugin that allows to simulate set of slap back delays combined with equalization will be very helpful while doing
	spacial processing. What do you think about it?

==== Analyzer ====
  Quirq:
    Back to the main topic, I'd dearly love to see a usable spectrum analyser that looked and behaved like Voxengo's SPAN:
    I use it for mix/mastering analysis; I was giving feedback to a friend for a CD release in December and looked again
    for comparable native analysers but went back to SPAN, even though it was a bit of a pain launching it separately and
    connecting everything up. (Now I've got Carla-rack that would be much, much less of an issue. But still it would be great
    to have something native.)
    I've looked at all the native analysers and none of them seem to come close. It's nice/clear to look at (important when
    you're using it for hours on end), the slope can be varied (useful for that gradual gentle slope down from low to high
    frequencies when things are balanced), but above all else, it's the fact that the display is smoothed and not at all spiky
    and is equally detailed across the spectrum (many analysers seem to be less detailed at the low end than they are for the
    highs). The image above looks like it's probably not on the more smoothed-out Mastering setting and is a bit spikier than
    the settings I use.

  ssj71:
    I think you are exactly right sadko, but Quirq is also right. Even though it's less accurate data,
    a mode like this can help the user to mentally process the data on screen better, even if it's less accurate.
    If you are using it for balance of frequencies, rather than trying to surgically remove or boost this or that
    freq, then I think a "frequency smoothed" mode is a good idea. Really it makes sense to have some independent
    control over smoothing WRT time AND/OR frequency. Especially with a few good presets ("Mastering," "high-accuracy," etc.)
    then it would be an even more useable and capable analyzer.

  Quirq:
    Thanks, you've very eloquently summarised what I was trying to say. The reason I got into using SPAN was because
    that's what the mastering engineer Ian Shepherd used in his Home Mastering EQ course (which I found incredibly useful).
    When I looked at all the native analysers to put things into practice, they all seem to be built more/just for precision,
    which is fine for most purposes but not as helpful for the broader-brush approach of mastering. 
  
    There are some analysers that are also scaled in a way that I don't find helpful – being marked 100, 200, 200, 400, 600, 800,
    1kHz, 2k etc with appropriate ticks in between is far more useful than 110, 220, 440, 880 etc. I understand why that's done,
    but it's harder to work out quickly where a feature of interest occurs in the spectrum unless it's centred around one of the
    marks. I think as well, having the area under the line makes things easier to read; most analysers do that, but not all.

==== Convolution Reverb ====

  As for the next one? I would like to see your take on a reverb. I've never really found one
  that I am satisfied with in linux. For convolution ardour cannot lot klangfalter lv2, the vst
  version loads but I'm not sure is completely stable. X42 plugins convolver is aimed at short
  impulses and has no controls, IR is unmaintained (I think) and, from experience, can have issues
  saving/loading parameters. For artificial reverb there are some good ones such as mverb but again
  I've never really felt very happy with them, none seem to offer the same kind of control that
  you can get with something like the Valhalla reverbs, epicVerb, or the new fabfilter reverb.
  
  An impulse purchase price of $30-$40 would be fine!

==== Multiband compressor ====
  I also thought that non-crossover multiband compressor is lacking linux audio. Crossovers do phase
  distortion at split points. Instead of this multiband compressor could be implemented as N-band
  equalizer with dynamically changing gain for each band where the gain is controlled as compression gain.
  
  That sounds excellent sadko4u, that's actually what I had in mind, I don't think there is anything like that for us.

==== Modulation Reverb ====
  A nice reverb plugin based on freeverb 3. It's old but does sound good IMHO.

==== Transient Designer ====
  Transient Designer I like to see. Calf has one but Calf works only sometimes in Ardour.

==== Tape simulator ====
  That's what I miss right now, as to what I really would like? A really good tape/dub delay with
  parameter changes which causes extreme zipper type effects, like Analogic Delay can produce.
  Tal Dub is amazing but it does not make the crazy sounds when you change the delay time which
  is a shame.

==== Saturator ====
  I'd say I think we're missing subtle saturation / distortion plugins. Stuff like
  VarietyOfSound used to put out -- FerricTDS, Tessla, the saturation stage in NastyVCS.

==== Filters ====
  A filter collection where you could use bezier or pixel-pencil to draw filter sweeps.
  
==== Noise Reduction ====
  I think noise reduction is the other big hole in LA currently.

==== Spring reverb ====
  Looking at scientific publications like this one, an accurate physical model of a spring reverb
  in real time seems out of reach for a longtime. 
  http://www.ness-music.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dafx13.pdf
  
  Do we have any resonator plugins? I used to use the on in ableton live years ago to create some
  quite nice spring reverb sounding fx when combined with the autofilter before the input. I can't
  think of any linux plugins that do anything similar.

==== Mastering ====
  On topic: I'd like to see, for example, a decent saturator, a multiband compressor, and
  a maximizer, possibly combined into one big mastering plugin.
  
==== Stereo image ====
  Oh, and one more. The thing we starve for really long is a good stereo image expander. Like the
  one you wrote for Calf project, but better.

==== Dynamic Equalizer ====
  Feature request for creating a Dynamic EQ plugin. If you're not familiar with them,
  it's basically an EQ, but it isn't applied until level passes the user defined threshold
  level. Or the inverse version where it is applied when the level drops below the threshold.
  
  Each parametric band would have it's own threshold / attack / release settings.
  Bonus points if a sidechain can be used for the dynamic triggering. Double bonus points if
  the dynamic triggering can optionally be set up to also (or possibly even exclusively) expand
  or contract the Q level. All the functionaly currently exist in the code base, it should mostly
  just be a matter of re-wiring the components.

  There is no LV2 implementation of this plugin to my knowlege. Outside of LV2, the free
  Nova Dynamic EQ vst plugin is an example of this implemented elsewhere.

==== Parameter entering ====
  In other subject, it would be great to be able to enter numerical values by double clicking
  on the DB value under the knobs.

==== Lookahead option ====
  Some dynamics plugins feature lookahead, some don't. As it is a very useful feature
  (eg. on a sidechain gate, having the gate start closing 1ms or so before the trigger makes it even more
  effective) and the code is there already, I feel it would be a welcome addition.

  Seconding this request, lookahead would be incredible and make the dynamics plugins very hard to beat.
  
==== Music stuff ====
  i plan on switching completely to linux for my mixing and mastering needs, i like the calf plugins,
  i appreciate the plugins it already contains, i just feel some cool things I'm looking for aren't there
  these are my feature request,
    - analog style emulated compresses, eqs, etc.
    - auto tune plugin
    - vocal rider type of plugin, that rides the track volume like the one pro tools has

==== Delay ====
  Re-implement Jesse Chappell's per-frequency delay from FreqTweak as a plugin. Bonus points:
  include frequency modulator functionality.

  This is kinda random, but there are not ladspa, lv2 plugins anything like the spectral delay
  functionality found in freqtweak. And it is starting to suffer from some significant bit-rot.
  Would be nice to be able to use it as a plugin.
