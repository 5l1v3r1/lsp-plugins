*******************************************************************************
* FEATURE REQUESTS: Detailed
*******************************************************************************

==== Dynamic Equalizer ====
  Feature request for creating a Dynamic EQ plugin. If you're not familiar with them,
  it's basically an EQ, but it isn't applied until level passes the user defined threshold
  level. Or the inverse version where it is applied when the level drops below the threshold.
  
  Each parametric band would have it's own threshold / attack / release settings.
  Bonus points if a sidechain can be used for the dynamic triggering. Double bonus points if
  the dynamic triggering can optionally be set up to also (or possibly even exclusively) expand
  or contract the Q level. All the functionaly currently exist in the code base, it should mostly
  just be a matter of re-wiring the components.

  There is no LV2 implementation of this plugin to my knowlege. Outside of LV2, the free
  Nova Dynamic EQ vst plugin is an example of this implemented elsewhere.

==== Parameter entering ====
  In other subject, it would be great to be able to enter numerical values by double clicking
  on the DB value under the knobs.

==== Lookahead option ====
  Some dynamics plugins feature lookahead, some don't. As it is a very useful feature
  (eg. on a sidechain gate, having the gate start closing 1ms or so before the trigger makes it even more
  effective) and the code is there already, I feel it would be a welcome addition.

  Seconding this request, lookahead would be incredible and make the dynamics plugins very hard to beat.
  
==== Music stuff ====
  i plan on switching completely to linux for my mixing and mastering needs, i like the calf plugins,
  i appreciate the plugins it already contains, i just feel some cool things I'm looking for aren't there
  these are my feature request,
    - analog style emulated compresses, eqs, etc.
    - auto tune plugin
    - vocal rider type of plugin, that rides the track volume like the one pro tools has

==== Delay ====
  Re-implement Jesse Chappell's per-frequency delay from FreqTweak as a plugin. Bonus points:
  include frequency modulator functionality.

  This is kinda random, but there are not ladspa, lv2 plugins anything like the spectral delay
  functionality found in freqtweak. And it is starting to suffer from some significant bit-rot.
  Would be nice to be able to use it as a plugin.
