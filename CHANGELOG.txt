* RECENT CHANGES
*******************************************************************************

=== 1.0.6 ===
* Reorganized source tree. Splitted plugin metadata into separate files and moved from core to the new directory.
* Fixed errors in formulas of noise envelopes for Spektrumanalysator.
* Fixed some bugs in DSP SSE module functions caused to possible crash plugins on some conditions.
* Implemented audio resampling algorithm for audio files using N-period Lanczos kernel convolution.
* Implemented some core primitives like Toggle, Blink etc.
* Added support of MIDI events for LV2.
* Added support of MIDI events for VST.
* Added support of plugin state serialization for VST.
* Implemented port sets for reducing plugin's port overhead.
* Implemented indexed proxy ports for the UI.
* Re-engineered LV2 Atom transport subsystem.
* Re-engineered LinuxVST transport subsystem.
* Additional feature ('quick tune') implemented for knob control (available when clicking on the knob's scale).
* Implemented serialization/deserialization of plugin state to plain text files (available in UI when clicking on logo or model acronym).
* Optimized the size of XML data (implemented 'ui:for' tag for cycles in XML documents).
* Optimized LV2 TTL generator for more compact RDF output, fixed some problems in RDF format.
* Changed the color of 'Bypass' swtich to red.
* Implemented Klangerzeuger (Sampler) plugin Mono/Stereo series
* Implemented Schlagzeug (Multi-Sampler) plugin x12, x24, x48 Stereo/Direktausgabe (DirectOut) series

=== 1.0.4 ===

* Reduced size of mesh to 192 points for Phasendetektor.
* Reduced mesh refresh rate to 20 Hz.
* Fixed metadata for Phasendetektor (ID of 'best value' meter was mistyped).
* Added LV2 Units support for the plugins.
* Optimized some of bulk data operations with SSE.
* SSE-based DSP module now is built-in for all releases and dynamically turns on when possible.
* Implemented FFT algorithm with SSE-specific optimizations.
* Implemented support of ports containing file names for LV2 (LV2 Paths).
* Implemented support of plugin state serialization for LV2 (LV2 State).
* Implemented support of LV2 worker interface (LV2 Worker).
* Implemented support of native worker interface (based on pthreads).
* Implemented Spektrumanalysator (Spectrum Analyser) plugin series (x1, x2, x4, x8, x12 and x16).

=== 1.0.3 ===

* Reduced mesh primitive synchronization rate to 25 Hz for LV2 Atoms.
* Simplified core plugin class.
* Simplified plugin UI class.
* Optimized DSP for SSE instruction set.
* Optimized Phasendetektor for DSP usage.
* Changed name of LinuxVST distribution from 'vst' to 'lxvst'.
* Removed dynamic_cast from C++ code and RTTI from linkage.
* XML documents now are built-in resources, expat library is required
  only for building binaries.

=== 1.0.2 ===

* Implemented plugin wrapping layer for more flexible plugin control.
* Added GUI wrapper for LinuxVST plugins.

=== 1.0.1 ===

* Fixed bugs in SSE assembly code discovered at 44100 Hz sample rate.
* Optimized SSE DSP processor: now it doesn't need to be an instance
  of the class.
* Fixed assertion issues with GTK+ support on UI close and destroy
  for LV2.
* Implemented generic LinuxVST support for plugins. Currently UI is not
  supported.
* Updated plugin metadata to become more compatible with VST.

=== 1.0.0 ===

* Initial version. Implemented plugins:
  - LSP Phasendetektor - Phase Detector
  - LSP Verz√∂gerungsausgleicher - Delay compensator
