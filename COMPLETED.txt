*******************************************************************************

==== Equalizer ====
  Norlick:
    Any way to make the EQ frequency display focus on a smaller range? Most of my EQing is
    within 5dB of change so on the current spectrum it looks like very miniscule changes.

==== Convolvers ====
  Anton Stankevich
    I often use a Calf Eq 5 after reberb effect. It will be nice to have some parametric equalization for reverb wet signal.
    This feature can help to give more presence for vocal with reverb for example.

==== UI bugs ====
  Tom Moody:
    2. Oscillator, VST:
      The controls underneath the dropdown menu in "Oscillator Function" are missing. You can switch between waveforms in the menu.
      The  Oversampling function does not appear under "General."
      Everthing else in the "General" section works well. So does the Waveform graph.

    3. Oscillator, LV2:
      The LV2 has similar issues to the VST but they can be corrected (somewhat) by closing and reopening the plugin interface.
      The main ones are: The controls underneath the dropdown menu in "Oscillator Function" freeze, and don't change when you
      select a new waveform. Sometimes "Oversampling" appears, sometimes it's blank.

    I just tried 1.1.0 JACK version of the plugins. In the trigger plugins the Instrument menu
    item doesn't open a file chooser, so samples can't be loaded.
    In the IR plugins the file chooser works fine and I can load IR files without a problem.
    I use cwm window manager on Debian 9 amd64. I don't have any LV2 hosts on my system (I'm
    using non-DAW which is LADSPA only), hence the need for the standalone JACK versions.

==== Delays ====
  jonetsu:
    The benefit with using delays is that there are no tails to manage. Also, those delays can be colorized by
    EQ (dull is farther, bright is closer) and adjusted accordingly with compression. The compression has to work
    in the same way as the EQ, not against.

  sadko4u:
	Your explanations helped me to understand what another plugin we are currently missing in linux audio. I think that
	plugin that allows to simulate set of slap back delays combined with equalization will be very helpful while doing
	spacial processing. What do you think about it?

==== Lookahead option ====
  Some dynamics plugins feature lookahead, some don't. As it is a very useful feature
  (eg. on a sidechain gate, having the gate start closing 1ms or so before the trigger makes it even more
  effective) and the code is there already, I feel it would be a welcome addition.

  Seconding this request, lookahead would be incredible and make the dynamics plugins very hard to beat.
  
==== Limiter issue ====
  Tom Moody:
    On the limiter issue:
    1. I am using Ubuntu Studio 16.04, Ardour 5.6. No Calf plugins (one reason I tried out LSP is I kept having
       Ardour crashes and am trying to have a "life without Calf")
    2. The limiter doesn't crash Ardour. I have had the limiter GUI freeze but I can't duplicate this at the moment.
       Possibly this was an issue with Ardour 5.5 -- I'll let you know if it happens again.
    3. If the limiter GUI is open, when I open the export dialog, the limiter GUI stays on top of the export window.
       To view the export window, I have to move the limiter GUI to one side. When I export, the export window shows
       no moving progress bar, it just sits there until the file is exported, then the "analysis window" pops up on
       conclusion of the export. There is no movement in the limiter GUI window during the export, either, until the
       very conclusion of the export, then a little squiggle of audio appears in the graph, just at the fade.
    It's a minor issue. One thing I wanted to mention, on a positive note. I've been using the PSP Vintage Warmer plugin
    on Windows as a maximizer for a final, admittedly non-expert master. I am gradually moving everything to Linux, and your
    limiter in "boost" mode is an excellent replacement for the PSP. Much appreciated.
