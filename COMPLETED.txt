==== Compensation delay ====
  unfa:
    I've recently used a-Delay to create a comb-filter effect in my session. 
    It's really great for that kind of stuff, but one thing that could be improved is
    the resolution of the Time parameter.

	When making an automation ramp going from 1 ms to 5 ms over 8 bars you an clearly
	hear the individual steps of the parameter being taken. I wish this parameter could
	have higher resolution so I could make automation of that with not stairsteps, even
	with very slow automation.

==== Slapback delay ====
  Marcel
	I was playing with the Slapback Delay to get some "Giorgio Moroder-like" synth disco bass.
	It is working great, but I have calculate all the time the delays I need for fitting the beat.
	And when I change the bpm I have to set up a new Slapback Delay with other settings.

	Would it be possible to add a delay mode  by which you can set delay based on synced beats instead
	of time and distance? Would be nice to have a " synced beat" with the rotary knob you could increase
	in steps of 1/16 up to e.g 64/16.

==== Multiband compressor ====
  Marcel:
    I have one question though. I don't see a multi-band compressor.
    It that something still in the pipeline? Would be great to have one.
    Keep on the good work, and of course when I like the plugins I will make a donation. 
    
  sadko4u:
    I also thought that non-crossover multiband compressor is lacking linux audio. Crossovers do phase
    distortion at split points. Instead of this multiband compressor could be implemented as N-band
    equalizer with dynamically changing gain for each band where the gain is controlled as compression gain.
  
  sysrqer:
    That sounds excellent sadko4u, that's actually what I had in mind, I don't think there is anything like that for us.
    
  sysrqer:
	Being able to move the bars on the graph with the mouse would be fantastic.

==== Sampler ====
  robb:
    with your LSP Sampler, is it possible to have it obey note-off? Ie. If i release the key, the
    sample stops playing? Currently, it seems that a sample plays through to the end each time, no
    matter how long the keypress is for... 
    
  Julian:
    Is it possible to configure samples so that it stops playing when receiving a midi note off? So
    far I haven't been able to.

==== Equalizer ====
  Norlick:
    Any way to make the EQ frequency display focus on a smaller range? Most of my EQing is
    within 5dB of change so on the current spectrum it looks like very miniscule changes.

==== Convolvers ====
  Anton Stankevich
    I often use a Calf Eq 5 after reberb effect. It will be nice to have some parametric equalization for reverb wet signal.
    This feature can help to give more presence for vocal with reverb for example.

==== UI bugs ====
  Tom Moody:
    2. Oscillator, VST:
      The controls underneath the dropdown menu in "Oscillator Function" are missing. You can switch between waveforms in the menu.
      The  Oversampling function does not appear under "General."
      Everthing else in the "General" section works well. So does the Waveform graph.

    3. Oscillator, LV2:
      The LV2 has similar issues to the VST but they can be corrected (somewhat) by closing and reopening the plugin interface.
      The main ones are: The controls underneath the dropdown menu in "Oscillator Function" freeze, and don't change when you
      select a new waveform. Sometimes "Oversampling" appears, sometimes it's blank. 

  JohnR
    I just tried 1.1.0 JACK version of the plugins. In the trigger plugins the Instrument menu
    item doesn't open a file chooser, so samples can't be loaded.
    In the IR plugins the file chooser works fine and I can load IR files without a problem.
    I use cwm window manager on Debian 9 amd64. I don't have any LV2 hosts on my system (I'm
    using non-DAW which is LADSPA only), hence the need for the standalone JACK versions.

==== Delays ====
  jonetsu:
    The benefit with using delays is that there are no tails to manage. Also, those delays can be colorized by
    EQ (dull is farther, bright is closer) and adjusted accordingly with compression. The compression has to work
    in the same way as the EQ, not against.

  sadko4u:
	Your explanations helped me to understand what another plugin we are currently missing in linux audio. I think that
	plugin that allows to simulate set of slap back delays combined with equalization will be very helpful while doing
	spacial processing. What do you think about it?

==== Lookahead option ====
  Some dynamics plugins feature lookahead, some don't. As it is a very useful feature
  (eg. on a sidechain gate, having the gate start closing 1ms or so before the trigger makes it even more
  effective) and the code is there already, I feel it would be a welcome addition.

  Seconding this request, lookahead would be incredible and make the dynamics plugins very hard to beat.
  
==== Limiter issue ====
  Tom Moody:
    On the limiter issue:
    1. I am using Ubuntu Studio 16.04, Ardour 5.6. No Calf plugins (one reason I tried out LSP is I kept having
       Ardour crashes and am trying to have a "life without Calf")
    2. The limiter doesn't crash Ardour. I have had the limiter GUI freeze but I can't duplicate this at the moment.
       Possibly this was an issue with Ardour 5.5 -- I'll let you know if it happens again.
    3. If the limiter GUI is open, when I open the export dialog, the limiter GUI stays on top of the export window.
       To view the export window, I have to move the limiter GUI to one side. When I export, the export window shows
       no moving progress bar, it just sits there until the file is exported, then the "analysis window" pops up on
       conclusion of the export. There is no movement in the limiter GUI window during the export, either, until the
       very conclusion of the export, then a little squiggle of audio appears in the graph, just at the fade.
    It's a minor issue. One thing I wanted to mention, on a positive note. I've been using the PSP Vintage Warmer plugin
    on Windows as a maximizer for a final, admittedly non-expert master. I am gradually moving everything to Linux, and your
    limiter in "boost" mode is an excellent replacement for the PSP. Much appreciated.
